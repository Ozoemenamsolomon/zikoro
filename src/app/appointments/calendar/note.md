Algorithm for Building Calendar with Monthly and Weekly Views
1. Project Setup
Initialize a new Next.js project.
Install necessary libraries: supabase, date-fns, and any other utility libraries.
2. Design the Calendar UI
Monthly View: Display a grid of dates for the selected month. Each date cell should show appointments for that day.
Weekly View: Display a grid of hours for the selected week. Each hour cell should show appointments for that time.
3. Fetch Appointments Data
Connect to the Supabase database and fetch appointments based on the selected date range (month or week).
Structure the fetched data to fit the monthly or weekly view.
4. Implement Monthly View
Generate dates for the selected month.
Fetch appointments for the month.
Display appointments for each date.
5. Implement Weekly View
Generate hours for the selected week.
Fetch appointments for the week.
Display appointments for each hour in the selected week.
6. Handle Edge Cases
Handle months with different number of days.
Handle appointments spanning multiple days or hours.
Ensure data fetching handles network errors and retries if necessary.
7. Styling
Use Tailwind CSS for styling the calendar components.

2. Design the Calendar UI
Monthly View

Display a grid of dates for the current month.
Each date cell should show the number of appointments or details if space permits.
Weekly View

Display a grid of hours (24 hours) for the current week.
Each hour cell should show appointments scheduled for that time.
3. Fetch Appointments Data
Supabase Setup

Create a Supabase project and table for storing appointments.
Appointments table structure:
id (primary key)
title (string)
description (string)
start_time (timestamp)
end_time (timestamp)
user_id (foreign key to users table, if multi-user support is needed)
Fetch Appointments

Create a Supabase client in Next.js to fetch appointments based on date range.
4. Implement Monthly View
Generate Dates for the Month

Use date-fns to generate a list of dates for the selected month.
Consider the edge case where the month starts mid-week and ends mid-week.
Fetch Appointments for the Month

Fetch appointments that fall within the start and end dates of the month.
Display Appointments for Each Date

Loop through the dates and display the appointments for each date.
5. Implement Weekly View
Generate Hours for the Week

Use date-fns to generate a list of hours for the selected week.
Fetch Appointments for the Week

Fetch appointments that fall within the start and end dates of the week.
Display Appointments for Each Hour

Loop through the hours and display the appointments for each hour.
Edge Cases and Considerations
Leap Years and Varying Days in Months

Ensure the monthly view correctly handles months with 28, 29, 30, and 31 days.
Appointments Spanning Multiple Days or Hours

Handle appointments that start on one day and end on another.
Network Errors

Implement retry logic for network requests.
Display error messages if data fetching fails.
Timezone Differences

Ensure the calendar correctly displays appointments in the user's local timezone.

Considerations
Pagination and Load More: Implement pagination or load more functionality if there are too many appointments to fetch at once.
Date Range Handling: Ensure date ranges are correctly formatted and timezone-aware.
Responsive Design: Use Tailwind CSS to ensure the calendar is responsive and looks good on all devices.
Error Handling: Implement error handling for data fetching and display user-friendly error messages.
This detailed algorithm should guide you through building a calendar with monthly and weekly views in Next.js, fetching data from Supabase, and handling various edge cases. Once we finalize the algorithm, we can proceed to the actual implementation.
