            TERMS, THEN YOU ARE EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED FROM USING THE SERVICES AND

            accepted, the changes in any revised Legal Terms by your continued
            use of the Services after the date such revised Legal Terms are
            posted. The Services are intended for users who are at least 13
            years of age. All users who are minors in the jurisdiction in which
            they reside (generally under the age of 18) must have the permission
